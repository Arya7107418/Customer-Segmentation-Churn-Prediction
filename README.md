# Customer-Segmentation-Churn-Prediction

# E-commerce Customer Analytics & Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
Built comprehensive customer analytics solution analyzing 3,774+ e-commerce customers to predict churn probability and optimize retention strategies using RFM segmentation and machine learning algorithms.

## Business Impact
* **Revenue Analysis**: Analyzed $1.8M total customer base with average CLV of $477
* **Customer Segmentation**: Identified high-value customer segments through RFM methodology
* **Churn Prevention**: Developed predictive model to identify at-risk customers for targeted retention
* **Strategic Insights**: Generated actionable recommendations for marketing and customer success teams

## Technical Implementation

### Data Processing & Analysis
* **Dataset**: 3,774 customer records with 20+ behavioral and demographic features
* **Feature Engineering**: Created RFM scores (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) for customer segmentation
* **Data Quality**: Handled missing values, outliers, and feature scaling for model optimization

### Machine Learning Pipeline
* **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier with hyperparameter optimization
* **Model Performance**: Achieved strong predictive accuracy for churn classification
* **Validation**: Cross-validation and performance metrics (precision, recall, F1-score)
* **Feature Importance**: Identified key drivers of customer churn behavior

### Customer Segmentation
* **RFM Analysis**: Segmented customers into behavioral cohorts
* **Risk Categories**: Classified customers by churn probability and value
* **Retention Strategies**: Designed targeted campaigns for each customer segment

## Key Findings
* **High-Risk Segments**: Identified customer groups with elevated churn probability
* **Revenue Opportunities**: Quantified potential revenue impact of retention strategies
* **Behavioral Patterns**: Uncovered key factors influencing customer loyalty and satisfaction

## Technologies Used
* **Programming**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
* **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Machine Learning**: Random Forest, Feature Engineering, Model Validation
* **Business Analytics**: RFM Segmentation, Customer Lifetime Value Analysis

## Business Applications
* **Marketing Teams**: Targeted retention campaigns for high-risk customers
* **Product Strategy**: Feature optimization based on churn drivers
* **Customer Success**: Proactive intervention strategies for at-risk accounts
* **Executive Reporting**: Data-driven insights for strategic decision making
